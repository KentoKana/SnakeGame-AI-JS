# SnakeGame-AI-JS
Basic Snake game AI written in JavaScript. Feedback is welcome!

Currently, the snake moves towards the apple using a series of simple conditional statements. 
The snake's individual movement sequence is printed out on the browser, after the user types "go" when prompted.

My next goal is to increase the length of the snake after eating the apple. As well, I will need to re-print the apple on another coordinate, once the snake 'eats' it. 

You can currently see the "score" structure in the code - the intent is to stop the code from running once the score reaches a certain threshold. 

Once the foundation is coded, I will be working towards adding algorithms to avoid certain objects (i.e. its own body, wall, other snakes, etc.).
